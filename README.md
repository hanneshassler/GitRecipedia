# GitRecipedia
A program and database to maintain, create, scale, convert cooking recipes and ingredients. 

This program is intended to be used by cooks who want do to following:

Convert a cooking recipe with arbitrary units to units of their choice. For instance
converting from ounces, cups and table spoons to grams and millilitres.

Convert an x-person recipe to an y-person recipe.

Check out how much calories, proteins, carbohydrates and fat are included in a specific
recipe.

Merge several recipes for a specific dish to create a new recipe being the average of them.

Maintain a personal recipe database.

Maintain a personal ingredient database.

Exchange recipes with friends or a bigger audience in a standardized way. This can happen peer to peer 
between friends or using the powerful github tools.


Level of professionalism

There are different types of professionals and depending which type you are (or at
a time choose to be) you will want to use this package in your specific way.

You might be an amateur or professional cook who wants to checkout recipes.
Then you can simply use the database (db directory) and open the file recipes.xml
with any webbrowser without bothering to install the program itself.

You might be a geek cook who likes to work on his recipes, exchange with fellow cooks and
generally increase your recipe stock. Then you want to install also the program and work with 
that.

You might even contribute to the program itself when you feel that it deserves new features,
neccessary or profitable for cooks. Again there are several ways: The simplest is to open an issue
at githup and someone will have a look at it and (hopefully) integrate it into the program.
Or you might even decide that you want to contribute to the program itself, when you are
familiar with Java and the process how it is handled on github.
