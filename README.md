# GitRecipedia
is program and database to maintain, create, scale, convert cooking recipes and ingredients. 

GitRecipedia is intended to be used by (geek) cooks for various reasons. Some
of their requirements are:

Convert a cooking recipe with arbitrary units to units of their choice. For instance
converting from ounces, cups and table spoons to grams and millilitres.

Convert an x-person recipe to an y-person recipe.

Check out how much calories, proteins, carbohydrates and fat are included in a specific
recipe.

Merge several recipes for a specific dish to create a new recipe being the average of them,
for instance to create the perfect cookie recipe.
(still in construction phase)

Maintain a personal database for recipes and ingredients.

Exchange recipes with friends or a bigger audience in a standardized way. This can happen peer to peer 
between friends or using the powerful github tools.

Currently (that is April 2015) GitRecipedia is still a work in progress. Check out the issue list;
some of the described features are still simply on that list that wait to be implemented.


Level of professionalism

There are different types of professionals and depending which type you are (or at
a time choose to be) you will want to use this package in your specific way.

You might be an amateur or professional cook who wants to checkout recipes.
Then you might simply use the database (db directory) and open the file recipes.xml
with any webbrowser without bothering to run GitRecipedia itself.

You might be a geek cook who likes to work on his recipes, exchange with fellow cooks and
generally increase your recipe stock. Then GitRecipedia will come handy.

You might even consider contributing to the program itself when you find bugs or
feel that it deserves new features, neccessary or profitable for cooks. 
Again there are several ways: The simplest is to open an issue
at githup and someone (probably me) will have a look at it and (hopefully) integrate it into the program.
Or you might even decide that you want to write this piece of code yourself and make a pull request on github
so I might integrate it into the master version. 

It is also my hope that such a tool brings together cooks to collaborate
on recipes, and possibly in this process new recipes are created (helped by the
merging feature of GitRecipedia)
